@article{Weininger1988,
abstract = {SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) is a chemical notation system designed for modern chemical information processing. Based on principles of molecular graph theory, SMILES allows rigorous structure specification by use of a very small and natural grammar. The SMILES notation system is also well suited for high-speed machine processing. The resulting ease of usage by the chemist and machine compatability allow many highly efficient chemical computer applications to be designed including generation of a unique notation, constant-speed (zerceth order) database retrieval, flexible substructure searching, and property prediction models.},
